# Book_Recommendation_System
Description:
Book recommendation system is designed to suggest books to users based on their preferences, reading history, or other relevant factors. The goal of a recommendation system is to provide personalized and relevant book suggestions to users, helping them discover new books they might enjoy.

Approach: 
The dataset used for recommendation systems consists of three tables: Books, Users, and Ratings. The data is preprocessed and cleaned for each table separately, including handling null values, correcting invalid entries, and removing duplicates. Various recommendation algorithms are then implemented, such as popularity-based recommendations, collaborative filtering, nearest neighbor-based recommendations. These algorithms offer different approaches to generating personalized book recommendations based on factors like ratings, author, publisher, publication year, and book title similarities. By leveraging these algorithms, we can receive tailored book recommendations.
